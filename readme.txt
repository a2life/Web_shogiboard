This is a readme file for shogiboard system.
The program reads data input(s) and render shogiboard(s) and mimic piece moves.
This was primarily conceived to be used on my shogi learning site to show various moves and explain shogi plays. 
See shogishack.net for this code snippet in action.

The program works on MODX Revolution CMS.  the coding is in PHP and javascript.
PHP utilizes several MODX APIs and utilities available through its manager screen. 

JavaScriptOnlySolutin contains sample.html  and other helper js files to render this board without a need of 
modx nor PHP. Core engine is the same with modx/PHP solution however, it lacks kifufile parser.(defined as PHP class)
I have no intention of creating kifu parser with Javascript. This means you need to hand code moves as illustrated below
if you are interested in using Javascript only solution.
samle.html uses kifu moves that were parsed and generated by PHP/MODX framework.

In modx environment, the program can be invoked by a tag syntax on content page like so.

[[!renderShogiBoard ? parameters]

 parameters grammer follows modx rule. ie.,  &parameter1=`foo1` &parameter2=`foo2` etc.,

If no parameters are specified, then initial board setup (no handycap or Hirate) will be rendered.
If "moves","kifuID" or "file"  parameter is specified, then it will also add four to six buttons at the bottom of 
the board to move pieces.
Initial board setup is totally configurable via following parameters
  sOnHand, gOnHand, sOnBoard,gOnBoard, markerAt

Multiple rendering of the board on the same page is possible by calling the program repeatedly.
for instance
<div class="showToLeft">
[[!renderShogiBoard &gOnBoard=`55k`]]
</div>
<div class="showToRight">
[[!renderShogiBoard &sOnBoard=`22R`]]
</div>

parameters--
type    :  If set to 1, board is for tsume shogi and default onHand data will not load. 
           If set to 3 then komadai will not display.
smooth  : if set to 1, piece move is a sliding move
mysteryMoves :  When branch moves exists, then a dropdown list will be displayed at the branch point. It usually shows the
default move.  if this parameter is set to 1, then the first selection shows "Select" and not actual move.
sOnHand : string indicating on hand pieces for sente. default is none. ex. "l,l,p" (see below)
gOnHand : string indicating on hand pieces for gote. default is none ex. "l,l,p" (see below)
sOnBoard: string indicating on board pieces for sente. default is initial setup for sente for no handicap game. ex. "11l,21n,31s,41g,51k,13p,22b"
gOnBoard: string indicating on board pieces for sente. default is initial setup for gote for no handicap game. ex. "99l,28r"
markerAt: string Indicating the grid that is highlighted. default is "out of the way", ex., "24" for position ２四
file : when specified, the engine will parse the file and fill 'moves','sOnHand','gOnHand','sOnBoard','gOnBoard' parameters if they exists in
kifu file. Currently, the program will read kakinoki style kif file.
kifuID : when specified, the engine will parse the modx resource identified by KiuID. if file and kifuID is both specified, kifuID will be ignored.
file and kifuID supports kakinoki kif format, including branch and initial board setting. However it does not support komaochi setting.
moves : data representing piece moves. ex. "s-2627","g-8687","s-2526","g-8586" (this represents ２六歩、８四歩、２五歩、８五歩)

Shogiboard layout is all in html and css.
the general structural idea is

.shogiBoard - .forSnapshot -- .boardBase (all piece images on board will go here)
             |              |
             |              |-.senteMochigoma (all pieces that sente player has go here)
             |              |
             |              |-.goteMochigoma (all pieces that gote player has go there)
             |-.buttonBar

therefore, to change the shogiboard layout, modify the html (sboardTpl.html) and CSSs.
my apologies for using inconsistent camel strings.

Plaecement of shogi piece on the board is managed by class atributes of html <img> tag.
For example, to place Sente's king on the 55 location, the following image tag is created and inserted to .boardBase div
by the program.
<img src="[PathToKoma]/sou.png"  class="koma c5 r5" alt="" />
 .c5 and r5 place a piece to relevant location (column 5, row 5) according to css definition.
to move the piece from 55 to 44, the program will manupulate the class so that the tag will be now
<img src="[PathToKoma]/sou.png"  class="koma c4 r4" alt="" />
the browser will reposition the piece and it gives the illusion that the piece has "moved"


buttonBar block is dynamically created if "moves" exists. It is outside of "forSnapshot" Div document flow and positioned
independently.
This is because the "forSnapShot" content copy is created every time the move is made.
and this array of snapshot images will be used when user click "stepback" butoon.
If buttons are also copied over, then it will lose function binding and lose its functionality after the first stepback.

If kifuID or file parameter is specified, then the parser will analyze the kifu and prepare the 'moves' parameter.
or 'moves' parameter can be directly entered using the following rule.
move does not need to alternate between hands. Usually the notation goes like below.
s-xxxx,g-xxxx,s-xxxx,g-xxxx
but
s-xxxx,s-xxxx,s-xxxx,g-xxxx
is allowed. it will be handy for teaching purpose.

Branching is supported. Branch moves will be shown in front of button bar if the selections are available.

Piece represntations in moves, sOnHand,gOnHand,sOnBoard and gOnBoard parameters are as follows.
l : lance
L : lance promoted
n : Knight
N : Knight promoted
s : silver
S : silver promoted
r : Rook
R : Rook promoted
b : Bishop
B : Bishop promoted
k : King

Move notation

Anything after '*' is considered as a comment and will be displayed in comment window.
kifstr is 5 or 6 character string.
first character  ; Either s or g to notate the Side   s = sente(black) and g = gote (white) Note in shogi, the black moves first
second character :  '-' to indicate normal move, '+' to indicate promotion, 'd'  to indicate drop
third and fourth chars:  'move to" coordinate.  34 means 3d, 22 means 2b etc.,
fith and six column : 'move from' coordinate for '-' and '+'. in case of 'd' then only fifthcolumn will be used as piece indicator

example of move
"s-7677",  : white move a piece from 77 to 76
"g-3433",  : black moves a piece from 33 to 34
"sd55g",   : black drops a gold to 5e.
"g-3534*do you think this is cool?", : white moves a piece from 34 to 35. Comment windows displays"do you think this is cool?"
s+2228  : piece at the 28 position is moved to 22 and then get promoted.
"x"   : end of moves indicator

"x" by itself is a special character and denote end of moves.

Branch is supported in the following way

"kifst=1",  //fisrt move 1
"kifstr=2",// move 2
"kifstrJ3",// move 3 etc.,
"kifstrJ4:labelA1", // move 4. move 4 has branch. label should be assigned to the line to indicate its play.(ie., ３七銀etc.,
"kifstr=5:labelB1", // move 5
"x",
"C:4", // indicates branch move at 4th move.
"kifstr=4:labelB2", // and labelB2 is stuffed into the selectin list.
"kifstr=5",
"x",
"C:3",
"kifstr=3:LabelA2",
"kifstr=4",
"kifstr=5",
"kifstr=6",
"kifstr=7",
"x"

In the above example, when move reaches the third move (J3), list box will be created and the user is presented with a choice with
labelA1 and Label A2. If he choses label A1, then make a move, the user will then presented with the list box with choise of
LabelB1 and Label B2. 
This is difficult to manually write all this. most likely scenario is to use Kifu file parser to convert the kif file to the
above format.


[wish list]
add &size parameter : `small`, `smaller` etc., currently it is fixed to "small" size.
flip board option -- this probably will never be supported.
Create "modx" transport package to make modx installation as one button click, rather than copying over many files manually.

mixed size in the same page => need to change class name in the template chunk.
